Guess My Number Game
This is a simple guessing game where the player tries to guess a number between a specified range. The project uses HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

How to Play
Setup: Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Game Rules:
The game picks a random number between a specified range (default is 1 to 20).
You need to guess the number by entering it into the input field and clicking 'Check'.
After each guess, the game tells you if your guess is too high or too low.
You have a limited number of attempts (default is 5 attempts).
If you guess the correct number within the allowed attempts, you win!
If you run out of attempts without guessing correctly, you lose.
Customization:
You can modify the range of numbers and the number of attempts directly in the script.js file.
